# Testing Infrastructure Overhaul — Part 2 (Audit & Plan)

> ## ⚠ Plan realigned 2026-04-29 — read this before executing any phase
>
> The phase plan in §4 (Phase B "pure-logic coverage", Phase F
> "coverage threshold ratchet") and the response-section framing
> elsewhere are **partially superseded** following team review of an
> attempted Phase B Task ([Task #2977](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/issues/2977),
> [PR apps#2978](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/pull/2978),
> closed without merging). Two pieces of feedback apply globally:
>
> 1. **No low-value mock tests.** Architect: *"Ikke veldig mye verdi i
>    rene code coverage tester som bare tester en mock service
>    respons."* Pure unit tests whose only assertion is "mocked
>    dependency returns X → SUT returns Y" do not earn their keep
>    when the SUT is thin pass-through wiring. **Mock tests *with
>    real-logic assertions* are still fine** — the line is "does the
>    SUT have logic worth testing?", not "is a mock involved?"
> 2. **Coverage % is not a quality goal.** Tech lead: *"code coverage
>    i seg selv er jo ikke ett kvalitetsmål … tester på Metadata
>    Controller burde være tester som faktisk kjørte på database
>    ingest dataene våre, og sjekket at respons modellen var populert
>    som forventet i API responsen."* Tests are valued for the *bug
>    classes they catch*, not for the line/branch numbers they produce.
>
> Practical effect on what's below:
>
> - **Phase A** is unaffected (already merged; critical fixes,
>   not coverage).
> - **Phase B (M5'/M6'/M7') needs re-scoping** before any further
>   Tasks open: filter every candidate assembly with
>   *"is this real logic or pass-through wiring?"*. Real logic
>   (validation rules, mappers, computational helpers, complex
>   business rules) → unit tests still earn their keep — Part 1 Step 53
>   remains the model. Pass-through → don't test in isolation; cover
>   via integration tests against real infrastructure.
> - **B.1** (Metadata controllers) was addressed at Step 7 via
>   DB-backed integration tests + 4 production-bug fixes in
>   `PackageService` ([apps#2984](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/pull/2984)),
>   not the originally-planned Moq pattern.
> - **Phase F (L2'/L3') is deprioritized.** Adding more enforced
>   coverage floors / raising existing floors entrenches
>   coverage-as-quality-gate, the very thing dismissed. Existing
>   floors should be reframed as catastrophic-regression tripwires,
>   not as quality gates. Specific Task only opens if the team
>   explicitly endorses it.
> - **Step-doc convention:** `bugClassesCovered` (a list of named
>   bug classes the new tests defend against) is the new lead field;
>   `coverageDelta` is informational, not the goal. See
>   [`STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md` § Step doc template](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#step-doc-template).
> - **Phases C, D, E and the housekeeping items (DOC/CI #21) are
>   unaffected.** Live-DB tests, Azurite tests, mock consolidation,
>   source-comment migration, and the structural-check script all
>   produce value the team has already endorsed.
>
> Full rationale + verbatim quotes in the [Decision Log](#decision-log)
> entry dated 2026-04-29 (Step 7).

> **Status:** 🟢 **Phase A complete (2026-04-27).** Audit sections 1–4
> populated by Step 1; Phase A's bundled critical fixes (C1', C2', C3',
> C5'; C4' dismissed) shipped under T1 issue
> [#2947](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/issues/2947)
> in Steps 2–5; coverage baseline re-measured at Step 6 against the
> post-C5'-fix merged-cobertura view. **Phase B re-scoped at Step 7
> (2026-04-29);** B.1 effectively addressed via integration tests +
> bug fixes in [apps#2984](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/pull/2984)
> (Step 7) and [apps#2987](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/pull/2987)
> (Step 8 — CI fix); Step 9 covers `SearchPropertyBuilder` pure-logic.
> Phases C / D / E unaffected and pending; Phase F deprioritized.
> Workflow lives in [`STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md`](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md);
> the tracking conventions adopted from
> [`TRACKING_RETROSPECTIVE.md`](TRACKING_RETROSPECTIVE.md) are documented
> there. See the [Decision Log](#decision-log) below for the realignment.

## Why a Part 2?

By the end of Part 1 all of the originally identified issues (C1–C5,
M1–M8, L1–L3) were resolved and the phase plan was exhausted. The next
highest-value work was always going to be a **fresh audit** — many of the
baseline numbers have shifted materially since Step 12 and several new
areas (`Host.Pipeline`, `Host.Database`, `Host.MassTransit`, live-DB
Npgsql repository code, `Host.Lease` pending Azurite) were not yet covered
by any plan.

Rather than continue appending "steps 62+" to Part 1, we start a fresh
overhaul document so that:

- The scope of Part 2 stays crisp and auditable (a new list of IDs, e.g.
  C1'–C5', M1'–M8', L1'–L5').
- Part 1 remains a frozen historical record.
- Step numbering in `STEPS_PART_2/` starts at **Step 1** again, making
  cross-refs within Part 2 unambiguous.
- The Part 2 scaffold can adopt the tracking improvements identified in
  [`TRACKING_RETROSPECTIVE.md`](TRACKING_RETROSPECTIVE.md) from day one,
  rather than retrofitting them mid-phase.

## 1. Current State Audit

*Measured 2026-04-27 against branch `claude/peaceful-diffie-18e815` (base
`main` @ 5993088d). Coverage produced by
`eng/testing/run-coverage.ps1` over all 11 `*.Tests.csproj` projects;
results parsed and aggregated per-assembly across the 11 cobertura files
(max line%/branch% chosen — see §2 issue **C5'** for why the script's
own threshold check disagrees in workstation mode).*

### 1.1 Test project inventory

11 test projects, all xUnit v3 (2.0.3) on `net9.0` with MTP routing
enabled centrally. Numbers below are the **Step 6 re-baseline**
(post-T1 close); the original Step 1 anomalies (`ABAC.Tests` 0
discovered, 1 failing test in `Altinn.Authorization.Tests`) are
resolved.

| Project | Tests | Pass | Fail | Skip | Time | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `AccessMgmt.Tests` | 1196 | 1196 | 0 | 0 | ~131s | |
| `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Tests` | 58 | 58 | 0 | 0 | ~7s | |
| `Altinn.AccessManagement.Enduser.Api.Tests` | 351 | 342 | 0 | **9** | ~82s | L1' carry-overs |
| `Altinn.AccessManagement.ServiceOwner.Api.Tests` | 25 | 25 | 0 | 0 | ~59s | |
| `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Core.Tests` | 323 | 323 | 0 | 0 | ~39s | |
| `Altinn.AccessMgmt.PersistenceEF.Tests` | 41 | 41 | 0 | 0 | ~5s | |
| `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Lease.Tests` | 2 | 0 | 0 | **2** | ~0.2s | Azurite-blocked (M4') |
| `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline.Tests` ✨ | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | ~0.9s | NEW (Step 4 scaffold; Phase D.1 populates) |
| `Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Tests` | 45 | 40 | 0 | **5** | ~5s | L1' carry-overs |
| `Altinn.Authorization.PEP.Tests` | 92 | 92 | 0 | 0 | ~2s | |
| `Altinn.Authorization.Tests` | 402 | **402** ✅ | 0 | 0 | ~11s | C2' fixed in Step 5 |
| **Totals** | **2536** | **2520** | **0** | **16** | ~6.5 min wall-clock | |

Project-roster delta vs Step 1: `Altinn.Authorization.ABAC.Tests`
removed in Step 3 (was empty); `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline.Tests`
added in Step 4 (1 smoke test).

All 11 csproj files set `<TargetFramework></TargetFramework>` (empty) +
`<TargetFrameworks>net9.0</TargetFrameworks>` to defeat the singular TFM
inherited from `src/Directory.Build.props`, which would otherwise force
`dotnet test` back to VSTest and skip xUnit v3 discovery entirely (Part 1
Step 37). The MTP opt-in itself is set centrally — see §3.

### 1.2 Fixture inventory

5 active fixtures + 1 static singleton (`PostgresServer`):

| Fixture | File | Scope | Container deps | Consumers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`ApiFixture`** | [src/apps/Altinn.AccessManagement/test/Altinn.AccessManagement.TestUtils/Fixtures/ApiFixture.cs](../../src/apps/Altinn.AccessManagement/test/Altinn.AccessManagement.TestUtils/Fixtures/ApiFixture.cs) | per-test (`IAsyncLifetime`) | Postgres via `EFPostgresFactory` | 74 (dominant abstraction) |
| **`LegacyApiFixture`** | [src/apps/Altinn.AccessManagement/test/AccessMgmt.Tests/Fixtures/LegacyApiFixture.cs](../../src/apps/Altinn.AccessManagement/test/AccessMgmt.Tests/Fixtures/LegacyApiFixture.cs) | per-test (extends `ApiFixture`) | Postgres + Yuniql migrations | 5 (Dapper-repo / consent / delegation tests) |
| **`PostgresFixture`** | [src/apps/Altinn.AccessManagement/test/AccessMgmt.Tests/Fixtures/PostgresFixture.cs](../../src/apps/Altinn.AccessManagement/test/AccessMgmt.Tests/Fixtures/PostgresFixture.cs) | per-test via `PostgresServer` singleton | Postgres + Yuniql | 6 (low-level DB tests) |
| **`AuthorizationApiFixture`** | [src/apps/Altinn.Authorization/test/Altinn.Authorization.Tests/Fixtures/AuthorizationApiFixture.cs](../../src/apps/Altinn.Authorization/test/Altinn.Authorization.Tests/Fixtures/AuthorizationApiFixture.cs) | per-class (no `IAsyncLifetime`) | none (in-memory mocks) | 7 |
| **`PlatformFixture`** | [src/libs/Altinn.Authorization.Integration/test/Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Tests/PlatformFixture.cs](../../src/libs/Altinn.Authorization.Integration/test/Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Tests/PlatformFixture.cs) | plain class (manual lifecycle) | none | 5 |
| `PostgresServer` (static singleton) | (same file as `PostgresFixture`) | process-wide | Postgres | shared by `PostgresFixture` |

`ApiFixture` carries the docstring contract that won out in Part 1
Step 25: register `ConfigureServices` / seeds / appsettings overrides
**from the constructor only**, before the host is built; mid-test mutation
is silently ignored. `LegacyApiFixture` flips on
`PostgreSQLSettings:EnableDBConnection=true` + `RunIntegrationTests=true`
to opt the per-test database into the production Yuniql migration
pipeline at host startup.

### 1.3 Mock & test-helper inventory (selected — duplication flagged in §2 M1')

**`Altinn.AccessManagement.TestUtils/Mocks/`** (shared across
AccessManagement test projects): `Altinn2RightsClientMock`,
`AltinnRolesClientMock`, `DelegationChangeEventQueueMock`,
`PermitPdpMock`, `PolicyFactoryMock`, `PolicyRepositoryMock`,
`PolicyRetrievalPointMock`, `PolicyRetrievalPointWithWrittenPoliciesMock`,
`ProfileClientMock`, `PublicSigningKeyProviderMock`,
`ResourceRegistryClientMock`, `UserProfileLookupServiceMock` (12).

**`Altinn.AccessManagement.Tests/Mocks/`** + `Contexts/`: 14 additional
mocks specific to AccessMgmt integration tests (PDP variants, resource
registry, party/profile clients, configuration/JwtCookie stubs).

**`Altinn.Authorization.Tests/MockServices/`**: 15 mocks +
4 `*Stub` classes for the Authorization vertical.

**Confirmed near-duplicates** between AccessMgmt-TestUtils and
Authorization-MockServices: `PolicyRepositoryMock`,
`PolicyRetrievalPointMock`, `DelegationChangeEventQueueMock`,
`PublicSigningKeyProviderMock`, `ProfileClientMock` /
`ProfileMock`, `ResourceRegistryClientMock` / `ResourceRegistryMock`,
`JwtTokenMock`, `ConfigurationManagerStub`,
`JwtCookiePostConfigureOptionsStub` — at least 9, likely more once
behavior is diffed line-by-line.

### 1.4 Coverage baseline (line% / branch%, owned assemblies, merged cobertura)

**Re-baselined at Step 6** against the post-C5'-fix and post-Step-5
merged-cobertura view (`TestResults/coverage.cobertura.xml`). The
original Step 1 audit numbers used a max-across-files heuristic
because `run-coverage.ps1` produced 11 separate cobertura files and
the threshold script (pre-C5') couldn't aggregate; that heuristic
under-counted coverage whenever a test project covered different
lines of an assembly than another test project. The numbers below
are the true union — produced by `dotnet-coverage merge` then parsed
by the (now defensive) `check-coverage-thresholds.ps1`. **Five
assemblies improved by ≥ 9 pp purely from the measurement fix** (no
production-code change); see §1.6 for the breakdown.

Sorted by line%; **bold** = below 60% (audit threshold for "needs
work").

| # | Assembly | Line% | Branch% | Threshold | Δ vs Step 1 audit | Δ vs Part 1 final |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Altinn.AccessMgmt.PersistenceEF` | 99.03 | 95.53 | 90 (enf) | +0.25pp | +0.44pp |
| 2 | `Altinn.Authorization.Host` | 91.67 | 100.00 | — | ±0 | NEW |

| 6 | `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Enduser` | 73.88 | 65.36 | — | ±0 | +5.56pp |
| 7 | `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Internal` | **73.63** | **75.56** | — | **+25.07pp** 🎯 (was mis-counted) | +26.89pp ⬆️ |
| 8 | `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.ServiceOwner` | 69.58 | 57.94 | — | ±0 | -2.16pp |
| 9 | `Altinn.Authorization` | 69.14 | 72.72 | 60 (enf) | +0.14pp (Step 5 dead-code removal) | -1.77pp |
| 10 | `Altinn.AccessManagement.Core` | 66.49 | 63.37 | 60 (enf) | +3.20pp | +3.06pp |
| 11 | `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Enterprise` | 66.39 | 56.52 | 60 (enf) | ±0 | ±0 |
| 12 | `Altinn.Authorization.ABAC` | 63.28 | 63.52 | 60 (enf) | +0.11pp | -0.13pp |
| 13 | **`Altinn.Authorization.Host.Database`** | **59.42** | 76.92 | — | ±0 | NEW (just under 60) |
| 14 | **`Altinn.AccessManagement` (main app)** | **57.57** | 60.64 | 60 (warn) | +1.10pp | -0.62pp ⬇️ |
| 15 | **`Altinn.AccessManagement.Persistence`** | **57.29** | 34.14 | — | +12.39pp 🎯 | +12.35pp |

| 17 | **`Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Metadata`** | **51.53** | 51.11 | — | ±0 | +34.94pp ⬆️ |
| 18 | **`Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence`** | **47.32** | 34.27 | — | ±0 | +14.81pp (live-DB ceiling) |
| 19 | **`Altinn.AccessMgmt.Core`** | **44.96** | 35.05 | — | +11.30pp 🎯 | +27.65pp |
| 20 | **`Altinn.Authorization.Api.Contracts`** | **34.68** | 16.85 | — | +11.11pp | NEW (DTO-heavy — low-priority) |
| 21 | **`Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence.Core`** | **25.39** | 23.44 | — | +0.05pp | +16.61pp |
| 22 | **`Altinn.Authorization.Host.Lease`** | **6.87** | 4.17 | — | ±0 | BLOCKED on Azurite |
| 23 | **`Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline`** | **0.24** | 0.00 | — | +0.24pp (Step 4 smoke test) | NEW (~1.4k LOC; populating tests is Phase D.1) |

`Altinn.Authorization.Host.MassTransit` (~157 LOC, mostly POCOs) is also
absent from coverage because nothing references it from the test tree.

### 1.5 Sub-60% classification

By how the gap can be closed (informs phase ordering in §4). Numbers
below are the Step 6 re-baseline.

- **Pure-logic reachable (no container)** — `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Core` (44.96%), `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence.Core` (25.39%), `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Metadata` (51.53%), `Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Platform` (54.94% — `PaginatorStream<T>` + `TokenGenerator` deferred from Part 1), `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Database` (59.42%, small). **`Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Internal` exited this list at 73.63% under proper aggregation** (Step 1 had it at 48.56% from the C5'-affected max-across-files heuristic).
- **Needs live DB (Npgsql repos)** — `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence` (47.32%), `Altinn.AccessManagement.Persistence` (57.29% — much closer to 60% than Step 1 indicated). Both dominated by Dapper / `NpgsqlDataSource` repository code that can't be exercised without a real connection. Phase C target.
- **Needs Azurite** — `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Lease` (6.87%). Phase D.2 target.
- **No real tests yet** — `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline` (0.24% — only the Step 4 smoke test; ~1.4k LOC of substantive logic) and `Altinn.Authorization.Host.MassTransit` (no test project). Phase D.1 / D.3 target.
- **DTO/contracts** — `Altinn.Authorization.Api.Contracts` (34.68%). Mostly serialization records; minimal value in chasing.
- **Main-app shell** — `Altinn.AccessManagement` (57.57%). Mostly `Program.cs` startup + DI wiring, conventionally excluded from tight gating. **Regression vs Part 1 Step 12 (58.19%) is real but only -0.62pp under proper aggregation, not -1.72pp as Step 1 reported — see M2'.**

### 1.6 New sources of duplication / drift since Part 1 closed

- Mock duplication between vertical test trees (M1') was *flagged* in
  Part 1 Step 4 but never fully consolidated — entropy has grown rather
  than shrunk.
- **Most "regressions" Step 1 reported turned out to be measurement
  artefacts** of the C5' threshold-script bug. Re-baselined deltas vs
  Part 1 final:
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.ServiceOwner` -2.16pp (real — sole
    surviving regression).
  - `Altinn.Authorization` -1.77pp (was reported as -1.91pp; Step 5's
    dead-code removal recovers a small fraction).
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement` main app -0.62pp (was reported as
    -1.72pp; still a regression but materially smaller — investigate
    under M2').
- **Five assemblies under-counted by 9 pp+ purely from the C5'
  measurement bug**, with no production-code change between Part 1
  and Step 1:
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Internal` +25.07pp (48.56% → 73.63%)
    — closes most of M6'.
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement.Persistence` +12.39pp (44.90% → 57.29%)
    — closer to 60% than M3' anticipated.
  - `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Core` +11.30pp (33.66% → 44.96%) — M5' still
    real but smaller.
  - `Altinn.Authorization.Api.Contracts` +11.11pp (23.57% → 34.68%)
    — DTO-heavy, low priority either way.
  - `Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Platform` +9.56pp (45.38% →
    54.94%) — M7' still real but smaller.

## 2. Findings & Issues

Fresh ID namespace (`C1'`–`C5'`, `M1'`–`M8'`, `L1'`–`L5'`) to keep the
audit cleanly distinct from Part 1.

### Critical (correctness, security, dead code)

- ~~**C1'** — **`Altinn.Authorization.ABAC.Tests` is an empty test
  project.**~~ — **Resolved by Part 2 Step 3** ([03_Delete_Empty_ABAC_Tests.md](STEPS_PART_2/03_Delete_Empty_ABAC_Tests.md)).
  Project + its orphan `test/Directory.Build.props` deleted; removed
  from the root and per-package solution files;
  [`docs/testing/TEST_PROJECTS.md`](../TEST_PROJECTS.md#pkg-abac)
  updated to note that ABAC is exercised indirectly via
  `Altinn.Authorization.Tests` (~63 % line / 61 % branch). The
  centrally-enforced 60 % `Altinn.Authorization.ABAC` threshold
  continues to gate that indirect coverage.
- ~~**C2'** — **1 failing test**: `ValidateParty_NotAsAuthenticatedUser_Forbidden`
  in [`PartiesControllerTest.cs:167`](../../src/apps/Altinn.Authorization/test/Altinn.Authorization.Tests/PartiesControllerTest.cs:167)
  expected `HTTP 403 Forbidden` but received `HTTP 200 OK`.~~ —
  **Resolved by Part 2 Step 5** ([05_Remove_AccessManagementAuthorizedParties_Flag.md](STEPS_PART_2/05_Remove_AccessManagementAuthorizedParties_Flag.md)).
  Triage outcome: the failing test was hitting the legacy `else`
  branch of `PartiesController.ValidateSelectedParty`, which was
  gated by the `AccessManagementAuthorizedParties` feature flag. The
  team architect confirmed the flag has been always-on in production
  for some time and is ready to be removed entirely. Step 5 deletes
  the flag, the legacy code paths it gated (the `else` branches in
  both `GetPartyList` and `ValidateSelectedParty`), and the
  now-orphaned `IParties.GetParties` / `IParties.ValidateSelectedParty`
  methods plus their `PartiesWrapper` / `PartiesMock` impls. With the
  legacy path gone the test passes naturally, and the originally-
  flagged "authorization regression" framing turns out to have been a
  test-hits-dead-code artefact rather than a security-relevant
  condition in production. **No security advisory needed** — the
  flag's always-on prod state means the bug was never reachable in
  the field.
- ~~**C3'** — **`Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline` has no test project
  and 0% coverage** despite being ~1.4k LOC of substantive logic
  (hosted services, builders, segment/sink/source services, telemetry).
  Largest untested production library in the repo.~~ — **Scaffold
  landed in Part 2 Step 4** ([04_Scaffold_Host_Pipeline_Tests.md](STEPS_PART_2/04_Scaffold_Host_Pipeline_Tests.md)):
  new `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline.Tests` project with a single
  `PipelineMessage<T>` smoke test (one passing test confirms wiring + 
  prevents the C1' empty-project recurrence). The 0 %-coverage gap on
  the production assembly itself remains until Phase D.1 populates
  real tests; this step only paves the way.
- ~~**C4'** — **`AutoMapper 14.0.0` has a known high-severity vulnerability**
  (NU1903 / GHSA-rvv3-g6hj-g44x) — pinned in
  [`src/Directory.Packages.props:27`](../../src/Directory.Packages.props:27)
  and surfaced as a NU1903 warning in every restore of
  `Altinn.AccessManagement.csproj`. Investigate upgrade path (15.x?) or
  replacement.~~ — **Dismissed 2026-04-27.** AutoMapper transitioned from
  free to commercial-licensed in versions ≥ 15.x, so the upgrade path is
  blocked on a separate licensing decision; the specific advisory
  (GHSA-rvv3-g6hj-g44x) is not applicable to how this codebase uses
  AutoMapper. Restore-time NU1903 warning is accepted noise. Re-evaluate
  only if (a) the licensing situation changes, (b) AutoMapper publishes
  a free 14.x patch, or (c) usage patterns change in a way that makes
  the advisory relevant.
- ~~**C5'** — **`eng/testing/check-coverage-thresholds.ps1` produces
  false-positive threshold failures in workstation mode.**~~ —
  **Resolved by Part 2 Step 2** ([02_Fix_Coverage_Threshold_Aggregation.md](STEPS_PART_2/02_Fix_Coverage_Threshold_Aggregation.md)).
  `run-coverage.ps1` now invokes `dotnet-coverage merge` before the
  threshold check + ReportGenerator so each assembly appears exactly
  once; `check-coverage-thresholds.ps1` was additionally hardened with a
  two-phase aggregate-then-check (max line%/branch%, union Owned) so
  multi-file inputs no longer cascade into one spurious failure per
  per-test-project view. Side effect: the corrected aggregation
  reveals that the §1.4 baseline below *under-counted* several
  assemblies — see Step 2 verification for the deltas; the §1.4 table
  will be re-baselined when T1 (#2947) closes.

### Medium (coverage & cleanup)

- **M1'** — **Mock duplication between AccessManagement-TestUtils and
  Authorization-MockServices.** At least 9 near-identical mock/stub
  classes (see §1.3). Promote the canonical implementations into a
  cross-vertical helper (e.g. a new `Altinn.Authorization.TestCommon`
  package, or extend `Altinn.AccessManagement.TestUtils` and
  `ProjectReference` it from `Altinn.Authorization.Tests`).
- **M2'** — **`Altinn.AccessManagement` (main app) coverage regressed
  -0.62pp** (58.19% → 57.57%) since Part 1 Step 12 despite no
  test-deletion in Part 1's last 10 steps. Investigate which production
  files grew without matching tests; either add the tests or document
  the exclusion. *(Step 1 originally reported -1.72pp; the Step 6
  re-baseline shows the regression is materially smaller, but still
  real.)*
- **M3'** — **Live-DB Npgsql repository coverage.**
  `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence` (47.32%) is the dominant remaining
  gap; `Altinn.AccessManagement.Persistence` (57.29% — was 44.90% in
  Step 1, the C5' fix surfaced +12.39pp of measurement under-counting)
  is now close enough to 60% that small additions could push it over.
  Adopt `EFPostgresFactory` template clones inside a dedicated xUnit
  collection scoped to repository tests (Part 1 Phase 2.2 pattern).
  This is Phase C of the Part 2 plan. *(Reduced urgency vs Step 1: the
  baseline gap is smaller than originally feared.)*
- **M4'** — **`Altinn.Authorization.Host.Lease` (6.87%) is blocked on
  Azurite**, carried over from Part 1 Phase 6.5. Add an Azurite
  Testcontainers fixture to `TestUtils` (mirroring the `PostgresServer`
  pattern with the same `Assert.Skip` outage guard). Phase D.2 of the
  Part 2 plan.
- **M5'** — **`Altinn.AccessMgmt.Core` (44.96%) and
  `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence.Core` (25.39%) pure-logic gap.** Both
  ratcheted up significantly in Part 1 (Steps 42–60) but
  `Persistence.Core` remains very low. Identify remaining pure-logic
  targets (utility classes, builders, validation helpers).
- ~~**M6'** — **`Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Internal` (48.56%) and
  `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Metadata` (51.53%) controller gaps.**~~
  — **`Api.Internal` resolved by Step 6 re-baseline** (true coverage
  73.63%; the Step 1 number was a C5' measurement artefact). Only
  `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Metadata` (51.53%) remains as a
  controller gap; direct Moq-based tests (proven in Part 1 Steps 49
  and 53) can close it. **Reduced scope**: M6' is now `Api.Metadata`
  only.
- **M7'** — **`Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Platform` (54.94%)** —
  `RequestComposer` / `ResponseComposer` covered in Part 1 Step 60;
  `PaginatorStream<T>` and `TokenGenerator` still deferred (thin logic
  / key-vault dependency). Re-evaluate. *(Step 1 reported 45.38%; the
  C5' fix surfaced +9.56pp.)*
- **M8'** — **`Altinn.Authorization.Host.Database` (59.42%, just under
  60%)** and **`Altinn.Authorization.Host.MassTransit` (no test project,
  ~157 LOC of POCOs)**. Decide per-library: add a thin smoke suite, fold
  into existing tests (e.g. covered transitively by `AccessMgmt.Tests`),
  or accept the gap as architectural glue.

### Low (housekeeping & ratchet)

- **L1'** — **16 skipped tests** across 3 projects:
  - 9 in `Altinn.AccessManagement.Enduser.Api.Tests` — including
    `Sender_ConfirmsDraftRequest_ReturnsPending` (Part 1 carry-over) and
    `Receiver_ApprovesPendingPackageRequest_ReturnsApproved` ([Skip]ped
    in Part 1 Step 62 with a rewrite TODO).
  - 5 in `Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Tests`.
  - 2 in `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Lease.Tests` (Azurite-blocked,
    unblocked by **M4'**).
  Audit each skip — some are environmentally blocked, some are
  cleanup-able.
- **L2'** — **Coverage threshold ratchet stale.** Promote new
  consistently-passing assemblies into the enforced list (numbers from
  the Step 6 merged-cobertura re-baseline; reliable now that C5' is
  fixed):
  - `Altinn.Authorization.Host` (91.67%) — set floor 85.
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement.Integration` (88.35%) — set floor 80.
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Enduser` (73.88%) — set floor 70.
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Internal` (73.63%) — set floor 70.
    *(NEW Phase F candidate — Step 1 had it at 48.56% under the
    C5'-affected heuristic.)*
  - `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.ServiceOwner` (69.58%) — set floor 65.
  - Consider raising existing floors: Maskinporten 75→80 (now
    80.36%), PEP 75→78 (now 79.60%), AccessMgmt.PersistenceEF 90→95
    (now 99.03%).
- **L3'** — **`Altinn.AccessManagement` main-app warn-only ratchet at
  60% is currently *failing*** (57.57%) and regressing per **M2'**.
  Either drop the warn floor to 55% (interim, while M2' is investigated)
  or hold the line and treat the warning as an action item. *(Step 1
  reported the value as 56.47%; the Step 6 re-baseline shows the
  warn-floor delta is 2.43pp not 3.53pp — still a warning, but closer
  to closing.)*
- **L4'** — **Source-code `// See: ...` comments still use long Part 1
  paths** (`docs/testing/TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL/STEPS_PART_1/<N>_*.md`).
  New tests must use the short form
  ([`STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md` § Source-code cross-references](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#source-code-cross-references));
  decide whether to also migrate the existing Part 1 comments
  in-place (sweep-able via a single Grep + Edit).
- **L5'** — **xUnit v2 packages still pinned** in
  [`src/Directory.Packages.props`](../../src/Directory.Packages.props)
  (`xunit` 2.9.3, `xunit.runner.visualstudio` 3.1.5) despite all 11 test
  projects being on v3. The conditional reference logic in
  [`src/Directory.Build.targets`](../../src/Directory.Build.targets)
  only adds these when `XUnitVersion=v2`, so the version pins are dead.
  Remove to prevent accidental version-mixing in any future test project
  that forgets to set `XUnitVersion=v3`.

---

## 3. Best Practices Already Followed

Carry forward from Part 1, plus newly observed:

- **All 11 test projects on a single stack** — xUnit v3 (2.0.3),
  `net9.0`, FluentAssertions 7.0.0, Moq 4.20.72, Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
  17.14.1. No mixed-version drift.
- **MTP routing centralized** in
  [`src/Directory.Build.targets:8-15`](../../src/Directory.Build.targets:8):
  when `IsTestProject=true` *and* `XUnitVersion=v3`, the targets file
  sets `OutputType=Exe` and
  `TestingPlatformDotnetTestSupport=true` (the official MS opt-in).
  Test projects only need to set `XUnitVersion=v3` (already inherited
  from each `test/Directory.Build.props`) plus the
  `<TargetFramework></TargetFramework>` empty-singular trick; everything
  else flows through.
- **Centralized `IsTestProject=true`** in every `test/Directory.Build.props`
  (5 of them, one per vertical). Every test project automatically gets
  `coverlet.collector`, `coverlet.msbuild`, `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`,
  `xunit.v3`, `FluentAssertions`, `xunit` + `FluentAssertions` global
  usings — see
  [`src/Directory.Build.targets:25-62`](../../src/Directory.Build.targets:25).
- **Centralized package versions** via `Directory.Packages.props`
  (`ManagePackageVersionsCentrally=true`) — no per-project version
  pinning except in scoped subtree props.
- **Per-test DB isolation** via `EFPostgresFactory.Create()` /
  `PostgresServer.NewDatabase()` — each test gets a fresh cloned database
  on the shared Postgres container.
- **Docker-outage soft-skip** in
  [`PostgresServer.StartUsing`](../../src/apps/Altinn.AccessManagement/test/AccessMgmt.Tests/Fixtures/PostgresFixture.cs)
  — Testcontainers failures are converted to `Assert.Skip`, which surfaces
  as exit code 8 from MTP and is tolerated by CI's
  `--ignore-exit-code 8`.
- **Single-run CI** (Part 1 Step 41): one
  `dotnet-coverage collect -- dotnet test` invocation produces TRX +
  merged cobertura; `check-coverage-thresholds.ps1` parses-only. No
  duplicate test execution.
- **Vertical-scoped threshold enforcement** — assemblies are gated only
  if their source files live under the vertical's `OwnedRoot`; foreign
  assemblies are reported with `(ref)` for visibility but don't fail CI.
- **Auto `InternalsVisibleTo`** — non-test projects in the test build
  graph automatically get `InternalsVisibleTo($(AssemblyName).Tests)` via
  [`src/Directory.Build.targets:68`](../../src/Directory.Build.targets:68).
- **Shared fixture contract documented in code** — `ApiFixture`
  call-from-constructor-only contract (Part 1 Step 25) and
  `LegacyApiFixture` Yuniql-vs-pure-EF guidance are inline doc-commented.
- **Workstation parallel coverage collection** — `run-coverage.ps1`
  (Part 1 Step 41) runs each test project's `dotnet-coverage collect` in
  parallel, capping wall-clock at the slowest project (~2.5 min for
  `AccessMgmt.Tests`) instead of the serial sum.

---

## 4. Improvement Plan — Phases

Six phases, ordered by correctness/risk first then by effort.

### Phase A — Critical fixes (C1'–C5')

Block almost everything else until done. Small, well-scoped:

- ~~**A.1** — Resolve **C1'** `ABAC.Tests`: delete the empty project (and
  drop its INDEX.md / coverage row) OR add direct ABAC unit tests.~~ —
  **Done in Part 2 Step 3** (deleted; coverage stays indirect via
  `Altinn.Authorization.Tests`).
- ~~**A.2** — Resolve **C2'** failing `ValidateParty` test: triage — real
  auth regression in `PartiesController` vs mock drift; fix root cause,
  not the assertion.~~ — **Done in Part 2 Step 5** (architect confirmed
  the gating feature flag is always-on in prod and removable; deleted
  flag + legacy code paths; test passes naturally).
- ~~**A.3** — Resolve **C5'** `check-coverage-thresholds.ps1`
  false-positive: refactor to aggregate per-assembly across input files
  before threshold check.~~ — **Done in Part 2 Step 2**.
- ~~**A.4** — Investigate **C4'** AutoMapper 14.0.0 CVE.~~ — **Dropped**
  per dismissal of C4' (see §2). No work item.
- ~~**A.5** — Plan **C3'** `Host.Pipeline` test project: scaffold an empty
  `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline.Tests` project (xUnit v3 + the
  central wiring) without tests yet — paves the way for Phase D.~~ —
  **Done in Part 2 Step 4** (scaffolded with a single `PipelineMessage<T>`
  smoke test to avoid the C1' empty-project pattern).

### Phase B — Pure-logic coverage (M5', M6', M7')

> ⚠ **Re-scope required before any further B.x Task opens** — see the
> top-of-doc banner and the [Decision Log entry dated
> 2026-04-29 (Step 7)](#decision-log). This section's framing
> ("highest ROI per hour", per-assembly coverage % targets) was

> just delegate). Pure-logic unit tests are valuable for the
> *real-logic* portion only. Pass-through wiring is covered by

> to Y%."*

Highest ROI per hour. No container, no external dependencies. Continues
the Part 1 6.7d pattern (Steps 42–60) of direct unit tests with
`InternalsVisibleTo` where needed.

**Re-scoped at Step 6** following the C5'-fix re-baseline: several
items shrank materially because Step 1's max-across-files heuristic
under-counted. Updated targets (largest gap first):

- **B.1** — `Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Metadata` (51.53%) controller
  gap via Moq (M6'). *(`Altinn.AccessManagement.Api.Internal` was the
  other half of M6' but the Step 6 re-baseline shows it at 73.63%
  rather than the Step 1 figure of 48.56% — already passing the
  implicit 60% threshold, so dropped from B.1.)*
- **B.2** — `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence.Core` (25.39% — largest
  remaining pure-logic gap) and `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Core` (44.96%)
  remaining pure-logic reachable code (M5'). Continues Part 1 Steps
  42–60.
- **B.3** — `Altinn.Authorization.Integration.Platform` (54.94%) tail —
  `PaginatorStream<T>` and (if feasible without key-vault)
  `TokenGenerator` (M7'). *(Step 1 reported 45.38%; the C5' fix
  surfaced +9.56pp.)*

### Phase C — Live-DB coverage (M3')

Largest unit of coverage work; requires fixture investment first:

- **C.1** — Design a `RepositoryDbCollection` xUnit collection that
  shares the `EFPostgresFactory` template-clone fixture across the
  Npgsql-repo tests in `Altinn.AccessMgmt.Persistence` (47.32%) and
  `Altinn.AccessManagement.Persistence` (44.90%).
- **C.2** — Write the per-repository test classes against the live
  Postgres instance.

### Phase D — New test projects (C3', M4', M8')

Each needs a new test project + initial smoke suite:

- **D.1** — `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Pipeline.Tests` — covers the ~1.4k
  LOC currently at 0%.
- **D.2** — Unblock `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Lease.Tests` by adding an
  Azurite Testcontainers fixture to `TestUtils` (M4').
- **D.3** — Decide on `Host.Database` (~150 LOC) and `Host.MassTransit`
  (~157 LOC): thin smoke suite vs accept-the-gap (M8').

### Phase E — Housekeeping & drift (M1', M2', L1', L4', L5')

Interleavable with B–D, can batch into a single PR each:

- **E.1** — Mock consolidation across verticals (M1').
- **E.2** — Investigate and address `AccessManagement` main-app
  coverage regression (M2').
- **E.3** — Audit the 16 skipped tests (L1').
- **E.4** — Rewrite source-code `// See: ...` comments to short form
  (L4').
- **E.5** — Drop dead xUnit v2 package pins (L5').

### Phase F — Coverage threshold ratchet (L2', L3')

> ⚠ **Deprioritized 2026-04-29 (Step 7)** — see the
> [Decision Log entry](#decision-log). Adding more enforced coverage
> floors / raising existing floors entrenches coverage-as-quality-gate,
> the very thing the tech lead has explicitly dismissed
> (*"code coverage i seg selv er jo ikke ett kvalitetsmål"*). Do not
> open F.1 / F.2 Tasks without explicit team endorsement. Existing
> `coverage-thresholds.json` floors should be reframed (likely via a
> small separate Task) as **catastrophic-regression tripwires**
> (e.g. floors at the *current minus a meaningful margin* level so
> they catch large drops without serving as quality gates), not as
> aspirational targets to ratchet upward. SonarCloud's coverage
> exclusions for pass-through code are tracked separately as an
> eventual follow-up.

Last; codifies the gains from Phases B–D. Promotes assemblies into the
enforced list and bumps existing floors. `Altinn.AccessManagement`
warn-only floor decision (L3') depends on M2' outcome.

## 5. Execution Order & Dependencies

```
Phase A (critical)  ─┬──> blocks Phase F (ratchet depends on script fix C5')
                     │
Phase B (pure-logic) ┼──> Phase F
                     │
Phase C (live-DB) ───┤    requires C.1 fixture before C.2
                     │
Phase D (new projects) requires A.5 scaffold for D.1
                     │
Phase E (housekeeping) — interleavable throughout
                     │
                     └──> Phase F (final)
```

Strict prerequisites:

- **A.3 (C5' fix)** before **F**: ratchet promotion requires reliable
  threshold checking.
- **A.5 (C3' scaffold)** before **D.1**: pipeline tests need the project
  to exist.
- **D.2 (Azurite fixture)** before resolving the 2 `Host.Lease.Tests`
  skips in **L1'**.
- **C.1 (DB-repo fixture)** before **C.2** (per-repo tests).

Everything else is independently schedulable.

---

## Tracking Conventions

The day-to-day tracking workflow lives in
[`STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md`](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md). See its **Conventions**
section for:

- The [step-doc YAML front-matter template](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#step-doc-template)
  required on every step doc.
- The [step-doc filename convention](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#step-doc-filenames)
  (`<NN>_<Name>.md`, zero-padded).
- The [source-code cross-reference convention](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#source-code-cross-references)
  (`// See: overhaul part-N step M`).
- The [`Phase/Tag`](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#phasetag-column) and
  [`CovΔ (line)`](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#cov%CE%B4-line-column) column rules
  for the step log.
- The [recommended structural-check script](STEPS_PART_2/INDEX.md#structural-check-recommended-early-step)
  for INDEX.md (good early Part 2 step, not a blocker).

The **~50-steps-per-part cap** is also enforced from the Part 2 INDEX:
when the step log approaches 50 entries, this document is closed and a
`PART_3` is opened rather than letting the table grow to Part 1's 61-row
length.

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Step 61 (Part 1) | Start a Part 2 document for the fresh audit instead of extending Part 1 | Keeps Part 1 as a frozen historical record; new issue IDs get a clean namespace; step numbering restarts at 1. |
| 2026-04-27 (Part 2 scaffold) | Apply tracking improvements from [`TRACKING_RETROSPECTIVE.md`](TRACKING_RETROSPECTIVE.md) to the Part 2 scaffold *before* the kickoff audit | Cheaper than retrofitting mid-phase. Concrete changes: `Phase/Tag` + `CovΔ (line)` columns in the step-log table; YAML front matter required on every step doc; zero-padded step-doc filenames; `Last re-checked` column on Blocked Items; versioned (`v<date>`) handoff prompt; explicit ~50-step-per-part cap; short-form source-code cross-reference convention; structural-check script flagged as a recommended early step. Sidecar `steps.json` and an actual working linter script are deferred until a concrete consumer/incident motivates them. |
| 2026-04-27 (Part 2 Step 1) | Use **max-across-files** as the canonical per-assembly coverage number for the §1.4 baseline, not a merged cobertura | Workstation `run-coverage.ps1` produces 11 separate cobertura files. Until issue **C5'** is fixed, max line% per package is the cheapest conservative-upper-bound aggregation. CI's single-cobertura output is the long-term ground truth; once C5' lands the local-dev numbers will agree by construction. |
| 2026-04-27 (Part 2 Step 1) | Sequence Phase A (critical) before Phase F (ratchet promotion) | F (L2') depends on A.3 (C5' fix) — the threshold-check script is unreliable in workstation mode, so until it's fixed any ratchet promotion would be evaluated against false positives. |
| 2026-04-27 (Part 2 Step 5 rectification) | Replace Step 5's original cross-user-check hoist with full removal of the `AccessManagementAuthorizedParties` flag and its dead-code paths | The team architect confirmed the flag has been always-on in production for some time and is ready to retire. The originally-flagged "auth regression" was a test-hits-dead-code artefact (the test class flipped the mocked flag to `false` mid-class, exposing the legacy `else` branch); in the field, the legacy path was never reachable. Patching dead code is wasted effort — the right move is to delete it. The original Step 5 commit was force-rebased out of the branch's history before this PR opened; the corrected Step 5 commit deletes the flag entirely (and the now-orphaned `IParties.GetParties` / `ValidateSelectedParty` methods + their `PartiesWrapper` and `PartiesMock` impls). **No security advisory needed.** |
| 2026-04-27 (Part 2 Step 6) | Re-baseline §§1.1/1.4/1.5/1.6 against the post-C5'-fix merged-cobertura view; supersede the Step 1 max-across-files numbers | C5' is fixed (Step 2). Merged cobertura is the canonical view. Five assemblies were under-counted by 9pp+ purely from the Step 1 measurement bug — keeping Step 1's numbers would mis-direct Phase B effort (most notably toward `Api.Internal`, which is actually 73.63% not 48.56%). Original Step 1 numbers preserved in the Step 1 doc's `coverageDelta:` front-matter for historical reference. |
| 2026-04-27 (Part 2 Step 6) | Bundle T1's PR α (Steps 1–4 infra/docs) and PR β (Step 5 dead-code removal) into a single PR per user direction | User explicitly preferred fewer review cycles given the tech-lead-approval cost. The Step 5 change is single-purpose (delete the flag + its dead paths) and clearly callable-out in the PR body, so review-isolation isn't structurally needed. Tradeoff: tech lead reviews everything in one shot, but with an explicit "Flag removal" header so the production diff is easy to find. |
| 2026-04-29 (Part 2 Step 7) | **Realign the Part 2 plan after team feedback dismissed coverage-driven framing.** Close [PR apps#2978](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/pull/2978) (B.1 / Task #2977) without merging; replace it with DB-backed integration tests + 4 production-bug fixes on `PackageService` ([PR apps#2984](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/pull/2984)); banner Phase B as needing per-assembly re-scope under a "real logic vs pass-through wiring" filter; deprioritize Phase F (coverage-threshold ratchet); change the step-doc convention so `bugClassesCovered` leads and `coverageDelta` becomes informational. | Three pieces of feedback received during PR apps#2978 review apply globally to the §4 plan: **(1) Architect:** *"Ikke veldig mye verdi i rene code coverage tester som bare tester en mock service respons."* — pure unit tests whose only assertion is "mocked dependency returns X → SUT returns Y" don't earn their keep when the SUT is thin pass-through wiring. Clarified afterwards: *"Tester på mock kan selvsagt ha verdi de også ja, gitt at de faktisk tester noe logikk ut over at APIet svarte 200 ok liksom."* — the line is "does the SUT have logic worth testing?", not "is a mock involved?" **(2) Tech lead:** *"Vi ønsker jo selvsagt å ha best mulig testdekning. Men code coverage i seg selv er jo ikke ett kvalitetsmål som gir noe verdi. Tester på Metadata Controller (som også ville gitt oss code coverage dekningen) burde jo være tester som faktisk kjørte på database ingest dataene våre, og sjekket at respons modellen var populert som forventet i API responsen. Så det testet modell mappingen og translation f.eks."* — coverage % itself is not a quality measure; tests are valued for the bug classes they catch. **(3) Tech lead, on a docs-only realignment PR:** *"Come back when you have actual code to merge."* Clarified afterwards: *"We still need to keep all of the tracking docs as well, we just don't have to bother the tech lead about a PR that contains only tracking docs and meta-work without any actual code in addition."* — tracking docs (this file, INDEX, step docs, Decision Log) **are still maintained**; they just ride along with code PRs rather than ship as standalone PRs. Combined effect: §4's per-assembly coverage-target framing is misaligned with team philosophy, and Phase F's whole premise (lock more assemblies into coverage-% gates in CI) becomes counter-productive. Specific decisions: B.1 closed in original Moq form, addressed in integration-test form (Step 7); Phase B requires the "real logic vs pass-through" filter before any further B.x Task opens; Phase F deprioritized (no F.x Task without explicit endorsement; existing floors should eventually be reframed as catastrophic-regression tripwires); step-doc front matter adds `bugClassesCovered` as the lead field; tracking-doc edits are bundled into code PRs. Phases A (already merged), C (live-DB), D (new test projects), E (housekeeping), and the DOC/CI items are unaffected. SonarCloud exclusions for pass-through code tracked as an eventual follow-up. |
