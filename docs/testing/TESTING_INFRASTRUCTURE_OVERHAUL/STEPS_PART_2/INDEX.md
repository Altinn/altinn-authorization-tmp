# Part 2 Step Log

Workflow tracker for the Part 2 testing-infrastructure overhaul.
Audit, open work, and decision history live in
[`../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL_PART_2.md`](../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL_PART_2.md).

## Read order (fresh chat)

1. This file — workflow rules, step log, blocked items.
2. [`../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL_PART_2.md`](../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL_PART_2.md)
   § Open work + § Decision Log.
3. The step doc for the work you're about to do (linked in the
   step log table below).

## Conventions

### Step doc template

Every step doc starts with this YAML, followed by Goal / What
changed / Verification / Deferred sections:

```yaml
---
step: <N>
title: <title>
phase: <A|B|C|D|E|CI|DOC|FIX>
status: complete | partial | blocked | reverted
linkedIssues:
  task: <issue#>
bugClassesCovered:
  - "<named bug class>"
verifiedTests: <count>
touchedFiles: <count>
---
```

`bugClassesCovered` is the **lead field**. If a step can't name at
least one concrete bug class its tests defend against, the work
probably violates the real-logic rule and shouldn't merge. Steps
that produce no new test coverage (tooling, dead-code removal, doc
revisions) can use `bugClassesCovered: []`.

### Step doc filenames

`<NN>_<Name>.md`, zero-padded so lexicographic order matches
chronological.

### Source-code cross-references

```csharp
// See: overhaul part-2 step 7
// See: overhaul part-1 step 17
```

This file is the single place that maps "part-N step M" → the
actual file path. When the folder is reorganized, only that
mapping needs updating.

### Branch naming

`feat/<task-issue#>_<short_name_with_underscores>` — branched from
`main`. No `claude/` prefix, no random codenames. One branch per
Task. Rename harness-default branches before pushing.

### GitHub Issues

Type `Task` (Issue Type, not label). Created **just-in-time** when
work starts, not upfront from the open-work list. Assignee
`howieandersen`, label `Backend`; add to project 50 ("Team
Tilgangsstyring & Kontroll") with current Sprint, Start = today,
Status = 👷In Progress. On close: Stop = today, Status = ✅ Done.

Bundle small Tasks into one PR (`Closes #X, #Y, #Z`) rather than
opening a PR per Task. PR title and body describe the change in
plain English — no internal audit IDs, no references to this file
or the audit doc.

### Step completion

1. Write the step doc.
2. Append a row to the [Step log](#step-log) below.
3. Run impacted tests; record results in the doc.
4. Re-check [Blocked items](#blocked-items); refresh
   `Last re-checked` even if nothing changed.
5. Commit (granular, push to working branch). Open a PR only when
   a coherent bundle is ready for review.

## Blocked items

`Last re-checked` is the most recent step that revisited the row.
Refresh it as part of every step's blocked-items sweep, even if
nothing changed.

| Item | Blocker | Notes | Last re-checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Altinn.Authorization.Host.Lease` tests | Azurite / Azure Storage Emulator required | 2 tests `[Skip]`ped; assembly at 6.87% line. Unblocked once an Azurite Testcontainers fixture lands. | step 22 |
| `Sender_ConfirmsDraftRequest_ReturnsPending` | Environmental investigation needed | `[Skip]`ped during Part 1 Step 51 after the `ResourceRegistryMock` cache-hit fix. Will be reviewed under skipped-test audit. | step 22 |
| `Receiver_ApprovesPendingPackageRequest_ReturnsApproved` | Fixture mis-seed — needs rewrite | `[Skip]`ped during Part 1 Step 62 with a TODO (auth as MD of receiver + pre-existing Rightholder connection). | step 22 |

## Recommended next

Pick from
[`../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL_PART_2.md` § Open work](../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL_PART_2.md#open-work).
Apply the real-logic-vs-pass-through filter and name the bug
classes the new tests defend against in the step-doc front matter.

---

## Splitting parts

When the step log approaches **~50 entries**, close Part 2 and
start Part 3 (`STEPS_PART_3/`,
`TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL_PART_3.md`). Part 1 ended at 61
steps; tables that long are unreadable. Part numbers are cheap.
