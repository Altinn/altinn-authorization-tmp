# Testing Infrastructure Overhaul — Step Log

## Getting Started & Workflow

**New chat?** Read these docs **in order** to get full context:

1. **This file** (`docs/testing/steps/INDEX.md`) — step log, coverage results,
   recommended next steps, deferred work, and workflow rules.
2. **[TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md](../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md)** —
   original audit, issue IDs (C1–C5, M1–M8, L1–L3), and the phase plan.
3. **The step doc for the work you're about to do** (linked in the table below or
   in the Recommended Next Steps section).

**When completing a step:**

- **Create a step doc** (`docs/testing/steps/<Step_Name>.md`) describing the goal,
  what changed, verification results, and any deferred items. Add a row to the
  step log table below linking to the new doc.
- **Run all tests that were changed or impacted by the step** and record the
  results in the step doc. Update the [Final Coverage (measured)](#final-coverage-measured)
  table at the bottom of this file if the step affected coverage of any listed
  assembly (or a new assembly that should be tracked).
- **Re-check the [Blocked Items](#blocked-items) section** to see if anything is
  now unblocked by the completed step. If so, move it into
  `### Recommended Next Steps (priority order)` at an appropriate priority and
  remove it from the Blocked Items table.
- **Sweep `docs/testing/steps/` for obsoleted docs.** Review every file under
  `docs/testing/steps/` and check whether any have been superseded or
  invalidated by the completed step (e.g. plans that are now fully executed,
  audits whose findings have all been addressed, POCs whose follow-up work is
  done). For each obsolete doc, either delete it and update links, or add a
  banner at the top pointing to the step that replaced it.
- **Commit and push** at the end of each step.
- **Recommend whether a new chat should be started** for the next step, based on complexity and context.
- **If a new chat is recommended, provide this ready-to-copy prompt** to hand off
  cleanly (don't rewrite it — `INDEX.md` already carries all the context):

  > Continue the testing infrastructure overhaul on branch
  > `feature/2842_Optimize_Test_Infrastructure_and_Performance`.
  >
  > Start by reading `docs/testing/steps/INDEX.md` — it's the entry point and tells
  > you exactly what to read next, how to pick the next step, and the workflow
  > rules for completing one.
  >
  > Then execute the highest-priority item from
  > `### Recommended Next Steps (priority order)` in that file.
- **Wait for explicit go-ahead** before proceeding to the next step.

**Picking the next step (when the list below is thinning):**

1. If `### Recommended Next Steps (priority order)` still has actionable
   items, take the highest-priority one.
2. If that list is empty or only contains blocked/unactionable items, consult
   [TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md](../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md)
   for the next actionable item from the phase plan, and add it back to the
   list below before starting.
3. If `TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md` is also exhausted of actionable
   work, the next step should itself be **a fresh audit of the current
   testing infrastructure** to identify the next most valuable improvements
   — produce an updated audit doc and a refreshed recommended-next-steps
   list, then resume the cycle.

Steps are listed in the order they were **actually completed**, not by the
original phase numbers in the [overhaul plan](../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md).

| 28 | ✅ | CI coverage thresholds for AccessManagement (4 enforced + 1 warn-only) | Phase 5.1b | [CI_Coverage_Thresholds_AccessManagement.md](CI_Coverage_Thresholds_AccessManagement.md) |
| 29 | ✅ | Coverage: AccessManagement.Api.ServiceOwner — closed the three untested `RequestController` endpoints; 54.35% → 71.74% line | Phase 6.7b | [Coverage_ServiceOwner_Api.md](Coverage_ServiceOwner_Api.md) |
| 30 | ✅ | Coverage: AccessManagement.Api.Enduser — closed five untested `RequestController` endpoints (`GetRequest`, `GetSentRequestsCount`, `GetReceivedRequestsCount`, `ApprovePackageRequest`, `ApproveResourceRequest`); 45.57% → 49.93% line | Phase 6.7c | [Coverage_Enduser_Api.md](Coverage_Enduser_Api.md) |
| 31 | ✅ | Coverage: AccessManagement.Api.Enduser Validation layer — `ConnectionValidation` + `ConnectionCombinationRules` direct unit tests via `InternalsVisibleTo`; 49.93% → 62.76% line | Phase 6.7c | [Coverage_Enduser_Api_Validation.md](Coverage_Enduser_Api_Validation.md) |

| 34 | ✅ | CI fix — scope coverage threshold enforcement to the owning vertical (unblocks `app: Authorization`, `lib: Integration`, `pkg: PEP`) | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_Coverage_Threshold_Scoping.md](CI_Coverage_Threshold_Scoping.md) |
| 35 | ✅ | CI fix — route `dotnet test` to Microsoft Testing Platform so xUnit v3 tests are actually discovered (fixes "No test is available" across all verticals) | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_Tests_MTP_Discovery.md](CI_Tests_MTP_Discovery.md) |
| 36 | ✅ | CI fix — post‑MTP hardening: make `FluentAssertions` available to test-helper libraries (fixes TestUtils CS0400) and detect xUnit v3 MTP executables cross‑platform in `run-coverage.ps1` (fixes Linux "No coverage files generated") | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_Post_MTP_Hardening.md](CI_Post_MTP_Hardening.md) |
| 37 | ✅ | CI fix — restore MTP routing by adding `<TargetFramework></TargetFramework>` inline to the 9 apps/libs test csprojs that regressed in commit `20ae747b` (singular inherited from `src/Directory.Build.props` silently forced `dotnet test` back to VSTest → "No test is available") | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_MTP_Routing_TargetFramework_Clear.md](CI_MTP_Routing_TargetFramework_Clear.md) |
| 38 | ✅ | CI fix — MTP follow-ups: forward `--results-directory`, `--report-xunit-trx`, `--ignore-exit-code 8` after `--` to the Sonar `analyze` job's inner `dotnet test` (restores Sonar test-result reporting + unblocks Host.Lease all-skipped vertical); document that `run-coverage.ps1`'s `dotnet-coverage collect -- dotnet <dll>` path uses xUnit v3's native runner (not MTP) and needs no exit-code handling | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_MTP_Followups_Sonar_And_Coverage.md](CI_MTP_Followups_Sonar_And_Coverage.md) |
| 39 | ✅ | Housekeeping — relocate build tooling out of `docs/`: `git mv` `run-coverage.ps1`, `run-accessmanagement-coverage.ps1`, `coverage-thresholds.json` from `docs/testing/` to `eng/testing/`; update 2 path strings + 1 comment in `tpl-vertical-ci.yml`. Scripts' internal `$PSScriptRoot` / `$repoRoot` paths unchanged (still 2 levels up) | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_Relocate_Scripts_to_Eng.md](CI_Relocate_Scripts_to_Eng.md) |
| 40 | ✅ | First green CI run follow-ups: Docker outage guard in `PostgresFixture`/`EFPostgresFactory` → `Assert.Skip`; upload MTP `*.log`/`*.trx` on failure; fix 3 Linux-specific test failures (Azurite-absent 5xx in `RequestController`, `'<'` → `'\0'` in `StringExtensionsTest` ×2); trim CI artifacts (drop `*.cobertura.xml`, `if: failure()`, retention 7→3 days) and redirect coverage-step per-project test stdout to `TestResults/<Project>.coverage.log` with tail echo on failure; PR review fixes in `TestCertificates`/`AuthorizationApiFixture`/`PolicyControllerTest` + stray file removal; new `Report failed tests` workflow step that parses MTP logs and emits per-failure `::group::` + `::error title::` annotations; follow-up fix removing the default `Accept: application/xml` header from `PolicyControllerTest`'s shared `_client` (introduced in Step 3) that was breaking the 8 JSON-parsing tests with `JsonReaderException: Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: <` — content negotiation returned XML which was fed into `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject`; Sonar fix on `Program.cs` (S1118 `protected Program()` + replace unresolved `<see cref="WebApplicationFactory{TEntryPoint}"/>` with `<c>` code span) | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_First_Green_Run_Hardening.md](CI_First_Green_Run_Hardening.md) |
| 41 | ✅ | CI perf — eliminate duplicate test execution: replace "Test" + "Coverage threshold check" steps in `tpl-vertical-ci.yml` with hybrid design. Step A = `dotnet-coverage collect -- dotnet test -- --ignore-exit-code 8` (single run, emits TRX + `TestResults/coverage.cobertura.xml`). Step B = parse-only `eng/testing/check-coverage-thresholds.ps1` (seconds). New shared script splits pretty-print + per-assembly threshold enforcement out of `run-coverage.ps1` so local-dev and CI stay in sync. `run-coverage.ps1` simplified (213 → 148 lines) to delegate to the shared script while keeping its parallel per-project `dotnet-coverage collect` loop for workstation use. Preserves step-level failure signal (tests-fail vs coverage-fail distinguishable) and removes the ~4m32s serial coverage re-run that made Coverage 2x slower than Test | Phase 6.6 follow-up | [CI_Coverage_Single_Run.md](CI_Coverage_Single_Run.md) |
| 42 | ✅ | Coverage 6.7d Part 1 — 65 new pure-logic unit tests (no container required): `FuzzySearch`+`SearchPropertyBuilder<T>` for both `AccessMgmt.Persistence.Core` and `AccessMgmt.Core`; `GenericFilterBuilder<T>` for `Persistence.Core`; `PackagesController` (Search/GetHierarchy/GetGroups/GetGroup) and `TypesController.GetOrganizationSubTypes` for `Api.Metadata` | Phase 6.7d | [Coverage_Phase_6_7d_Part1.md](Coverage_Phase_6_7d_Part1.md) |
| 43 | ✅ | Coverage 6.7d Part 2 — 46 new pure-logic unit tests: `ValidationComposer` (All/Any/Validate), `OrgUtil` (GetMaskinportenScopes/GetAuthenticatedParty/GetSupplierParty), `DbHelperMethods` (GetPostgresType all .NET types + nullable + PropertyInfo overload), `PostgresQueryBuilder` (BuildInsertQuery/BuildUpdateQuery/BuildSingleNullUpdateQuery/GetTableName/BuildBasicSelectQuery) | Phase 6.7d | [Coverage_Phase_6_7d_Part2.md](Coverage_Phase_6_7d_Part2.md) |
| 44 | ✅ | Coverage 6.7d Part 3 — 40 new pure-logic unit tests: `InternalsVisibleTo` added to `AccessMgmt.Core`; `ValidationRuleClassesTest` (28 tests: `EntityValidation`, `EntityTypeValidation`, `RoleValidation`, `AssignmentPackageValidation`, `DelegationValidation`, `PackageValidation`); `DbConverterTest` (10 tests: flat mapping, case-insensitivity, nulls, nullable Guid, `_rownumber` page info, unknown columns, `PreloadCache`) | Phase 6.7d | [Coverage_Phase_6_7d_Part3.md](Coverage_Phase_6_7d_Part3.md) |

### Recommended Next Steps (priority order)

All items below are actionable and have no container-runtime dependency.

1. **Phase 6 coverage improvements** — Fill identified gaps (can use FluentAssertions!):
   - **6.7d (continued):** AccessMgmt persistence/core layers — Parts 1–3 added FuzzySearch/GenericFilterBuilder/Metadata controllers, ValidationComposer/OrgUtil/DbHelperMethods/PostgresQueryBuilder, and all internal validation-rule classes + DbConverter. Remaining targets: `AccessMgmt.Core` mapper classes (`DtoMapper.*` etc.); `AccessMgmt.Persistence.Core` (`PostgresQueryBuilder.BuildExtendedSelectQuery` with joins + filter paths); `AccessMgmt.Persistence` (32.51%), `AccessManagement.Persistence` (44.94%), `AccessManagement.Api.Internal` (46.74%), `AccessManagement.Integration` (47.57%).
   - **6.7c (last follow-up):** `MaskinportenConsumersController` / `MaskinportenSuppliersController` — requires PDP stubbing or seeding of `altinn_maskinporten_scope_delegation` resource (controller-level integration test, distinct from the unit-test direction taken in Steps 31–33). See [Coverage_Enduser_Api_ToUuidResolver.md](Coverage_Enduser_Api_ToUuidResolver.md).
   - **6.7e:** (follow-up to Step 29) fix the two latent production bugs documented in [Coverage_ServiceOwner_Api.md](Coverage_ServiceOwner_Api.md) — `RequestController.CreatePackageRequest` query-param overload passes `Id` but not `ReferenceId` to the private helper; `PackageConstants.TryGetByName` throws when the name dictionary has duplicate keys. Also: `RequestController.CreateResourceRequest` query-param overload returns 400 instead of 202 (test `CreateResourceRequest_WithValidQueryParams_Returns202Accepted` is currently `[Skip]`ped in `ServiceOwner.Api.Tests/Controllers/RequestControllerTest.cs`).
   - **6.7f:** fix two Enduser `RequestController` failures that were previously masked by the VSTest discovery bug fixed in step 35 and are now `[Skip]`ped in `Enduser.Api.Tests/Controllers/RequestControllerTest.cs`: `Sender_GetSentRequests_ContainsSeededRequest` returns 401 Unauthorized for the sender viewing their own seeded request, and `Receiver_ApprovesPendingPackageRequest_ReturnsApproved` returns 400 BadRequest when the receiver approves via `PUT /received/approve`. Also: fix the `AuthorizationApiFixture` state pollution that makes `PDP_Decision_ResourceRegistry_AccessListAuthorization_Json_PermitWithActionFilterMatch` flaky when the full class runs (currently `[Skip]`ped — see step 35 deferred note).

See [AccessManagement_Coverage_Baseline_Success.md](AccessManagement_Coverage_Baseline_Success.md) for detailed coverage metrics.

### Blocked Items

| Item | Blocker | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 6.5: Host.Lease tests | Azure Storage Emulator/Azurite required | See [TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md](../TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL.md) Phase 6.5 |

### Final Coverage (measured)

**Altinn.Authorization app** (Phase 6 — CI-enforced):

| Assembly | Line% | Branch% | Threshold | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Altinn.Authorization | 70.91 | 70.93 | 60% | ✅ |
| Altinn.Authorization.ABAC | 63.41 | 63.83 | 60% | ✅ |
| Altinn.Authorization.PEP | 77.75 | 76.10 | 75% | ✅ |

**236 new tests** added across Phase 6 (184 Authorization + 52 PEP).

**AccessManagement app** — Step 12 baseline; four assemblies are now
**CI-enforced** as of Step 28 (see [CI_Coverage_Thresholds_AccessManagement.md](CI_Coverage_Thresholds_AccessManagement.md)).
The main app is a warning-only ratchet until it crosses 60%. Other assemblies
are tracked under priority 1 in [Recommended Next Steps](#recommended-next-steps-priority-order)
and will be enforced as their coverage improves. Source:
[AccessManagement_Coverage_Baseline_Success.md](AccessManagement_Coverage_Baseline_Success.md).
