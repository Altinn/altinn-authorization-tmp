# Fixtures

A *fixture* is the xUnit-managed object whose lifetime spans one test class
(`IClassFixture<T>`) or one collection (`ICollectionFixture<T>`). Integration
tests use fixtures to host a `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` and to provision
the backing PostgreSQL database.

This repo has **three** fixtures you should know about. Pick the simplest one
that works for what you're testing.

---

## 1. `ApiFixture` — canonical integration fixture

**Location:** `Altinn.AccessManagement.TestUtils/Fixtures/ApiFixture.cs`
**Use for:** All new AccessManagement integration tests.
**Database:** EF Core migrations, template-cloned per fixture via
`EFPostgresFactory`.

`ApiFixture` extends `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` and implements
`IAsyncLifetime`. It is composable — register configuration and service
overrides in the test-class constructor, not in test methods.

### Basic usage

```csharp
public class MyControllerTest : IClassFixture<ApiFixture>
{
    private readonly HttpClient _client;

    public MyControllerTest(ApiFixture fixture)
    {
        // Register overrides BEFORE requesting a client.
        fixture.ConfigureServices(services =>
        {
            services.AddSingleton<IFoo, FooMock>();
        });

        _client = fixture.CreateTestClient(c =>
        {
            c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
                new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", TestTokens.ForUser(1337));
        });
    }
}
```

### One-shot seeding

```csharp
fixture.EnsureSeedOnce<MyControllerTest>(async db =>
{
    db.Parties.Add(new Party { ... });
    await db.SaveChangesAsync();
});
```

The callback runs exactly once per fixture lifetime even when the fixture is
shared across classes via `ICollectionFixture<ApiFixture>`.

### Why you configure in the constructor only

Once `CreateClient()` / `CreateTestClient()` is called, the underlying
`IHost` is built and frozen. Any `ConfigureServices` registered after that
point is **silently ignored**. If you need a different configuration for a
subset of tests, put those tests in a dedicated class with its own fixture.

## 2. `AuthorizationApiFixture` — Authorization app fixture

**Location:** `Altinn.Authorization.Tests/Fixtures/AuthorizationApiFixture.cs`
**Use for:** All `Altinn.Authorization.Tests` controller tests.
**Database:** None — the Authorization app uses mocks for its data stores.

Pre-registers the full common mock graph for Authorization (PolicyRetrievalPoint,
PolicyRepository, DelegationMetadataRepository, signing key provider, events
queue, etc.) so test classes don't have to duplicate that wiring.

```csharp
public class DecisionControllerTest : IClassFixture<AuthorizationApiFixture>
{
    private readonly HttpClient _client;

    public DecisionControllerTest(AuthorizationApiFixture fixture)
    {
        // Add per-class overrides before building the client.
        fixture.ConfigureServices(s => s.AddSingleton<IContextHandler, MyHandler>());
        _client = fixture.CreateClient();
    }
}
```

For per-test variation, call `WithWebHostBuilder` — the common mocks are
inherited automatically:

```csharp
var client = fixture.WithWebHostBuilder(b =>
    b.ConfigureTestServices(s => s.AddSingleton<IFeatureManager>(customMock)))
    .CreateClient();
```

## 3. `LegacyApiFixture` — Yuniql-backed legacy tests

**Location:** `AccessMgmt.Tests/Fixtures/LegacyApiFixture.cs`
**Use for:** Legacy tests that depend on the full Yuniql-migrated schema and
haven't been rewritten against EF seed data yet.
**Database:** Yuniql migrations **and** EF schema side-by-side.

This fixture exists as an explicit bridge. New tests should **not** use it —
prefer `ApiFixture`. The expected outcome is that the last `LegacyApiFixture`
consumers get rewritten on EF seed data over time and the fixture is retired.
See [`TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL/steps/22_AccessMgmt_WAF_Group_B_16_4_Prep_LegacyApiFixture.md`](TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL/steps/22_AccessMgmt_WAF_Group_B_16_4_Prep_LegacyApiFixture.md).

## `EFPostgresFactory` — how the DB is provisioned

Under the hood, `ApiFixture` delegates database provisioning to
`EFPostgresFactory`. The strategy:

1. A **single** PostgreSQL container is shared across every fixture in the
   test run (reference counted).
2. EF Core migrations + static data are applied **once** to a **template**
   database.
3. Every fixture gets a fresh database via `CREATE DATABASE <name> WITH
   TEMPLATE <template>`. Cloning is ~100–500 ms, vs ~10+ seconds for
   re-running migrations.

`PostgresFixture` (a thin Testcontainers wrapper) is what `LegacyApiFixture`
uses; it is not intended for direct consumption by new tests.

### Graceful skip when no container runtime is available

Both `EFPostgresFactory` and `PostgresFixture` detect the absence of a Docker /
Podman socket and call `Assert.Skip(...)` so the suite doesn't fail on
developer machines without a runtime. See
[`TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL/steps/40_CI_First_Green_Run_Hardening.md`](TESTING_INFRASTRUCTURE_OVERHAUL/steps/40_CI_First_Green_Run_Hardening.md).

## Decision table

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| New AccessManagement integration test? | `ApiFixture` |
| New Authorization controller test? | `AuthorizationApiFixture` |
| Pure logic, no DI, no DB? | **No fixture.** Construct the SUT directly with Moq dependencies. |
| Repository / EF Core test? | `ApiFixture` or a minimal fixture built on `EFPostgresFactory`. |
| You see `LegacyApiFixture` in older tests? | Leave it as-is unless you're rewriting that file. Don't introduce new consumers. |
