# SonarCloud

SonarCloud runs static analysis on every push and PR — code smells, bugs,
security hotspots, duplication, and ingested test coverage. Each vertical
(`apps/*`, `libs/*`, `pkgs/*`) is its own SonarCloud project under the shared
[`altinn`](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/altinn) organization, scanned
in **monorepo mode** so projects are isolated despite sharing a repository.

## Where the config lives

| File | What it controls |
|---|---|
| [`SonarQube.Analysis.xml`](../SonarQube.Analysis.xml) | Shared analysis settings: organization, host, exclusions, coverage report paths, duplication exclusions. The single source of truth — referenced from CI via `/s:`. |
| [`.github/workflows/tpl-vertical-ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/tpl-vertical-ci.yml) | The `analyze` job. Passes per-vertical key/name and `SONAR_TOKEN` to `dotnet-sonarscanner`; everything else comes from the XML. |
| `src/apps/<vertical>/conf.json` | Per-vertical opt-in / project key (see below). |

The CI invocation is intentionally minimal:

```bash
dotnet-sonarscanner begin \
  /key:"$SONAR_KEY" \
  /name:"$SONAR_NAME" \
  /d:sonar.token="$SONAR_TOKEN" \
  /s:"$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/SonarQube.Analysis.xml"
```

If you need to change exclusions, coverage paths, or the quality-gate-wait
behaviour, edit the XML — not the workflow.

## Per-vertical setup

Each vertical's `conf.json` declares whether SonarCloud runs and under which
project key. Two shapes:

```jsonc
// Enabled
{ "sonarcloud": { "projectKey": "Authorization_AccessManagement" } }

// Disabled (the analyze job is skipped entirely)
{ "sonarcloud": false }
```

Current state:

| Vertical | Project key |
|---|---|
| `apps/Altinn.AccessManagement` | `Authorization_AccessManagement` |
| `apps/Altinn.Authorization` | `Authorization_Authorization` |
| `apps/Altinn.Register` | *disabled* (`sonarcloud: false`) |

To onboard a new vertical: create the SonarCloud project under the `altinn`
organization (Sonar UI → New project → GitHub → pick the repo → set monorepo
mode), then add `"sonarcloud": { "projectKey": "..." }` to its `conf.json`.

## Exclusions

`SonarQube.Analysis.xml` defines four orthogonal exclusion lists:

| Property | Effect | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `sonar.exclusions` | File is invisible to Sonar — no issues, metrics, or coverage | Migrations, generated `.g.cs` / `.Designer.cs`, the FFB / WebComponents folders |
| `sonar.test.exclusions` | File is not analyzed *as test code* | Everything under `**/test/**`, `*.Tests`, `*.TestUtils`, `*.Mocks` |
| `sonar.coverage.exclusions` | File is analyzed for issues but excluded from line-coverage % | Test code, `Program.cs` / `Startup.cs`, generated files, migrations |
| `sonar.cpd.exclusions` | File is exempt from copy/paste detection | Property-bag files: `Models/`, `Dto(s)/`, `Entities/`, `Contracts/`, `*Dto.cs`, `*Request.cs`, `*Response.cs` |

**Pick the narrowest one that solves your problem.** Most additions belong in
`coverage.exclusions` or `cpd.exclusions`; reach for `exclusions` only when
the file genuinely shouldn't be analyzed at all.

## Coverage import

Sonar consumes the `analyze` job's own coverage run (VSCoverage XML at
`TestResults/coverage.xml`) plus xUnit v3 TRX reports for test results. The
`build-and-test` job's cobertura coverage is **not** the same artifact — see
[issue #2934](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-authorization-tmp/issues/2934)
for the unification work and the coverage-format constraints. For local
coverage workflow see [testing/COVERAGE.md](testing/COVERAGE.md).

## Quality gate

The default SonarCloud quality gate applies. PR decoration posts inline
comments for issues introduced in the PR's "new code" period; the gate
result is reported as a check but **does not block merging**
(`sonar.qualitygate.wait=false` in the XML). To make it blocking, flip that
property to `true` — expect ~30–90 s added to PR check time.

## Common operations

**Add an exclusion.** Edit `SonarQube.Analysis.xml` and the change applies to
every vertical on the next CI run. No per-project config needed.

**Disable Sonar for a vertical.** Set `"sonarcloud": false` in the vertical's
`conf.json`. The `analyze` job's `if:` guard then skips it entirely — no
project deletion required on Sonar's side.

**Bump the scanner version.** Update the pinned version in two places that
must agree: the `--version` flag in the *Install SonarCloud scanner*
step in `tpl-vertical-ci.yml`, and the cache key prefix on the same job
(otherwise the cache hands the old binary to the new pinned install).

**Mark something as "won't fix" or "false positive".** Do it in the
SonarCloud UI for the affected vertical's project — these decisions are
project-scoped state, not source-controlled.

## Debugging a failed analyze run

1. Check the `Analyze` step log in the failing job. The scanner prints a
   summary URL near the end (`Quality gate status:` line) — open it for
   the per-issue breakdown.
2. If the failure is in `dotnet-sonarscanner begin`, the cause is usually
   an invalid `SONAR_TOKEN` or a project key mismatch. Confirm the key in
   `conf.json` matches a project that exists in the `altinn` org.
3. If `dotnet build` inside the analyze step fails but `build-and-test`
   succeeded, the issue is almost always the `--no-incremental` rebuild
   hitting an analyzer that's tolerated by the incremental build. Reproduce
   locally with `dotnet build --no-incremental`.
4. If coverage is reported as 0 % despite passing tests, check that
   `TestResults/coverage.xml` exists in the analyze job — the path is
   relative to the vertical's `working-directory`, not the repo root.
