/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Per source table the job makes one heavy pass that reconstructs each row's version chain
/// (live + history ordered by validfrom): the first version becomes a Created event, a history
/// version whose successor changes a trigger-relevant value becomes an Updated event, and a
/// final history version with no live row becomes a Deleted event — the same semantics as the
/// database triggers. The events land in a session temp table with names resolved through the
/// dbo.activitylog_* helper functions, and are then copied into dbo.activitylog in small
/// throttled batches. Only events strictly before the cutoff are staged, and an anti-join on
/// (itemid, trigger, when) skips events that already exist, so the job is idempotent and can be
/// stopped and resumed freely. Progress (latest event time copied) is written back to
/// dbo.activitylogbackfillprogress after every batch, and completedat marks a finished source.
///
/// Known limitation: Updated events are attributed to the successor version's audit_changedby.
/// That is the actual updater for EF-written updates, but raw-SQL updaters (FFB reparenting,
/// legacy scripts) do not refresh the audit columns, so for those versions the history only
/// knows the original creator — the true updater identity was never persisted and cannot be
/// backfilled. Version chains are ordered by (audit_validfrom, audit_validto) for the same
/// reason: raw-SQL updates leave audit_validfrom unchanged across versions.
